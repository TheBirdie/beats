optimizer = ipopt
# ipopt: high-level black-box nonlinear solver. does some quasi-newton stuff, requires gradient method
# rprop: heuristic method requiring gradient method, used by papageorgiou for similar work
# multistart: rprop w/ many initial starting points run in parallel
# chained: experimental combination of the above methods, best in JDR opinion

optimizer-max-iter = 30
# how many iterations to perform on gradient descent. ~ the # of gradient calls

optimizer-n-restarts = 1
# how many restarts to use when a multistart optimizer is used

objective = ttt
# ttt: minimize total travel time
# crit: penalize densities above critical. Attempt to "smooth" density peaks

soft-max-queue-length = 20.0
# penalize queues observed above this value. Attempts to limit amount of storage in queues.

soft-max-queue-factor = 1.0
# how strongly should queue violations be penalized
